Our project is to assemble an autonomous driving car that is able to help with pesticide control in a
farm. The car will be able to traverse from the location of one crop to another in the shortest distance
possible. The algorithm that we are using to find the shortest distance is a path finding algorithm
called Floydâ€“Warshall.
Below shows an example of the farm and its distance matrix:

![Farm_example](https://github.com/tyl1999tyl/BatMobile/blob/main/images/example_farm.png)

- The numbers in dark purple and circled are the nodes (a.k.a location of the crops). They are the
location that the robot car needs to reach.
- The numbers in red are the distances.
- The black lines are the path.
A demo of the algorithm in working is in floyd_warshall_demo.py. The distance matrix is inserted
and when the algorithm is run, we can get the shortest path that the robot needs to go through to get
from node A to node B. Example output:

```

The shortest path from 1 -> 2 is [1, 2] 
The shortest path from 1 -> 3 is [1, 2, 3]
The shortest path from 1 -> 4 is [1, 2, 3, 4]
The shortest path from 1 -> 5 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
The shortest path from 1 -> 6 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
The shortest path from 1 -> 7 is [1, 2, 9, 8, 7]
The shortest path from 1 -> 8 is [1, 2, 9, 8]
The shortest path from 1 -> 9 is [1, 2, 9]
The shortest path from 1 -> 10 is [1, 2, 9, 10]
